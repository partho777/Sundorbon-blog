            <h2>Saltwater <span class="Orange-color" >Crocodile</span></h2>
            <p>The saltwater crocodile is a skilled aquatic predator.Basking in the sun, the saltwater crocodile is a study in stillness but once it enters the brackish waters of the Sundarbans, it is the top aquatic predator. Its eyes are adapted to see underwater, and it has excellent night vision so the nocturnal reptile can hunt at night.The channels of the Sundarbans harbour a healthy population of the estuarine or saltwater crocodiles which thrive in this unique ecosystem. </p>
